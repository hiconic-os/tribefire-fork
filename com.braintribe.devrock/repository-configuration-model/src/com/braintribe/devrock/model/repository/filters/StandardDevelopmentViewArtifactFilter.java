 * ATTENTION: This filter is just experimental. It may be changed or removed anytime.<br>

 * a delegate {@link #getRestrictionFilter() restrictionFilter} to only restrict specified groups/artifacts but
 * otherwise matches everything else. This means that one can e.g. add a filter for tribefire and a few extensions.
 * Access to the respective groups/artifact/versions will be filtered as usual. Anything else will be fully matched
 * though, i.e. not restricted at all. This enables developers to e.g. add another extension or a third party library.
