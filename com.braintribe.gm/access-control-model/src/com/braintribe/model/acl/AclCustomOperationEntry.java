/**
 * Base for an {@link AclEntry} with a custom operation type.
 * <p>
 * The basic ACL entry sub-types are {@link AclStandardEntry}, which has {@link AclOperation} as it's operation type, which defines all it's possible
 * operations. Then there is {@link AclCustomOperationEntry}, which is modeled to be fully flexible, with it's operation property being of type
 * String, but that lacks the convenience of being able to select from a set of known values.
 * <p>
 * This entry is meant as mixture in between, where the sub-type is supposed to have a property called "operation" of any type it wants (most probably
 * a custom enum) and this abstract type ensures that the Acl mechanism uses the {@link Object#toString() toString} value of that operation.
 * <p>
 * NOTE that 
 * 
 * @see AclEntry
