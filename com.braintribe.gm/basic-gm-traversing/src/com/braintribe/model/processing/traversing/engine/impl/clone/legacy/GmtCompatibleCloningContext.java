/**
 * Marks a CloningContext to be compatible with gm-traversing. This means the {@link GMT} based cloning can use the
 * {@link CloningContextBasedClonerCustomization}.
 * <p>
 * Not every {@link CloningContext} implementation can be used in GMT. ClongingContext typically has access to a stack of values and
 * {@link TraversingCriterion}s which are not accessible in the GMT context. So any Cc implementation that accesses them is not GMT compatible. The
 * only exception is to check the peek TraversingCriterion, which is set in case of a property (as that is the only way to find out which property is being cloned). 
 * 
 * Also, the {@link CloningContext#preProcessInstanceToBeCloned(GenericEntity)} must return the same instance it gets as an argument.
