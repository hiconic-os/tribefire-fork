/**
 * Represents a custom initializer type that is bound from a module.
 * <p>
 * This kind of initializer is used when the same type of initialization is expected to be done many times, with just minor variations. In such case
 * an implementation is bound from a module, and multiple configuration assets, which brings the input files for this implementation.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #getName() name} property represents the qualified name of the input asset. The files are located inside the data folder in a dedicated
 * sub-folder, whose name is derived the same name as the folder for {@link ManInitializer}. This means the folder to get the folder name out of the
 * name property you have to replace the illegal characters with an underscore.
 * <p>
 * For more information see the platform asset nature called DynamicInitilizerInput.
