/**
 * Represents a part of one of the {@link PersistenceInitializer}'s initializing methods.
 * <p>
 * It differs from {@link PersistenceInitializer} in that the latter represents an entire persistence stage, while the
 * former might represent only a part of one of it's methods. In other words, one persistence stage of any number of
 * {@link DataInitializer}s.
 * <p>
 * This can be used when an initializer consists of multiple independent parts, and/or when we want to define an API
 * with an initializer being a {@link FunctionalInterface}. The prime example is the initializer configuration of a TF
 * module.
