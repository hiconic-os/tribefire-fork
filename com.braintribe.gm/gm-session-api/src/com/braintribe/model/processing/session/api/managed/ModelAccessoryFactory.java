	 * Returns a {@link ModelAccessoryFactory} with given model perspective. This perspective is a mechanism to cut use-case irrelevant meta-data from

	 * Perspective is a collection of meta-data domains, and each domain represents a collection of {@link MetaData}.
	 * <p>
	 * If a perspective is applied (on a model), only these meta data are kept and all others are stripped.
	 * <p>
	 * The platform itself defines both "ESSENTIAL" and "BASIC" domains (which pretty much comes down to "essential-meta-data-model" and
	 * "basic-meta-model"), and also defines a "PERSISTENCE_SESSION" perspective, which consists of these two domains. This is used as a mechanism for
	 * a persistence session, especially on a remote system, to only see important meta-data and not say hibernate mappings.
	 * <p>
	 * This perspective can be extended, or a custom can be defined, via methods of HardwiredExpertsContract.
	 * <p>
	 * NOTE that it is possible to call this method again, with a different perspective (i.e.
	 * <code>factory.forPerspective("foo").forPerspective("bar")</code>), which returns a factory that only applies the second perspective(i.e.
	 * "bar"</code>).
	 * 
	 * @param perspective
	 *            the perspective which is applied to strip irrelevant meta-data. <tt>null</tt> means no perspective is applied
