	 * <p>
	 * In normal situation, any meta-data defined on a given entity has higher priority than any meta-data coming from a super-type. Also, any
	 * meta-data on given property/enumConstant, has priority over meta-data coming from the owner (property MD may be defined for GmEntityTyp,
	 * enumConstant MD for GmEnumType. If, however, this flag is set to <tt>true</tt>, this MD is treated as if it was set directly on the item we are
	 * resolving for, and possible conflicts are only resolvable by {@link MetaData#setConflictPriority(Double) conflictPriority}.
	 * <p>
	 * This allows us to define e.g. property meta-data on some root type in a hierarchy, that are valid for all the properties of any entity in the
	 * hierarchy, and can only be overridden by means of higher conflictPriority.
	 * <p>
	 * For MD with the same hierarchy level (for entities) and same conflictPriority value a third criterion exists based on the model where they are
	 * defined. The closer to the one model given to MD resolver, the earlier the MD shows up. For example for entity types This means the MD defined
	 * on the actual type (as opposed to ones defined on overrides) has the lowest priority.
