/**
 * A {@link PredicateErasure} is a predicate that removes the positive effect of it's supertype. For example, for visibility we have a
 * {@link Predicate} called Visible. In order to make something not visible, we use a predicate called Hidden, which is a subtype of both Visible and
 * {@link PredicateErasure}, thus saying this negates the positive effect of Visible.
 * <p>
 * Note that one should (almost) never resolve a PredicateErasure with CmdResolver. When resolving the positive predicate, the resolved MD could be an
 * instance of that positive type, or the erasure, but the resolution of an erasure always returns just the erasure (obviously, as that is the
 * subtype). The CMD resolver would actually throw an exception if the predicate-specific resolution method would be used ({@code .is(Hidden.T)}), but
 * there is no exception when resolving in a general way (via {@code list()/exclusive()} methods).
