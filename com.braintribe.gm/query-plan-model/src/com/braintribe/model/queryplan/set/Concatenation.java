/**
 * A concatenation of two {@link TupleSet}s. Similar to {@link Union}, but does not check for duplicates, i.e. if some tuple is a member of both
 * operands, then it will be twice in the "set" represented by this entity.
 * <p>
 * Note however, that the intended usage is for cases where both operands are disjoint, in which this is the exact same thing as the aforementioned
 * {@link Union}, but can be implemented without any memory footprint.
 * 
 * <h4>Example:</h4>
 * 
 * <tt>SELECT * FROM A, B, WHERE (a.x > 3) OR (b.x > 3)</tt>
 * 
 * <code>
 * Concatenation {
 * 		firstOperand: CartesianProduct{ FilteredSet;, B} 
 * 		secondOperands: {
 * 			FilteredSet{
 * 				operand: CartesianProduct{ 
 * 							A, 
 * 							FilteredSet;
 * 						}
 * 				filter: NOT(a.x > 3)
 * 			}
 * 		]
 * }
 * </code>
 * 
 * Note that in order for this to work we need to apply the filter for the second set that is the negation of the filter from the first set (thus
 * making sure the two operands of the {@linkplain Concatenation} are disjoint).
 *
