/**
 * Represents a (partial) result of a query. If you think of a query result as a 2 dimensional matrix (array), then one tuple is a row in such matrix
 * and a "TupleSet" represents actually this entire matrix.
 * <p>
 * On a side note: Tuple actually means something like an array or a list. If you have 3 elements it's "triple", 4 - "quadruple", 5 - "quintuple",...
 * , n - "n-tuple". In general, if we do not want to specify the size, we just say "tuple". Simple as that.
 * <p>
 * From a one table perspective, a tuple is identical to a table row, but the term row is not very accurate when talking about a combination of data
 * from various tables (when doing joins/Cartesian product), so the tuple is the more general expression for this.
 * 
 * <h4>Why tuple sets when there are no tuples?</h4>
 * 
 * This entities only represent the plan for a query, they do not contain any data. See examples below.
 * 
 * @see SourceSet
 * @see IndexSet
 * @see StaticSet
 * @see FilteredSet
 * @see Union
 * @see Intersection
